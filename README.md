# Android-fundamentals-03.2-Unit-tests
Copied the Simple Calc app from the 03.1 Codelabs and use this app for the coding challenge of 03.02.  Challenge 1: Dividing by zero is always worth testing for, because it is a special case in arithmetic. How might you change the app to more gracefully handle divide by zero? To accomplish this challenge, start with a test that shows what the right behavior should be.  Remove the divTwoNumbersZero() method from CalculatorTest, and add a new unit test called divByZeroThrows() that tests the div() method with a second argument of zero, with the expected result as IllegalArgumentException.class. This test will pass, and as a result it will demonstrate that any division by zero will result in this exception.  After you learn how to write code for an Exception handler, your app can handle this exception gracefully by, for example, displaying a Toast message to the user to change Operand 2 from zero to another number.  Challenge 2: Sometimes it's difficult to isolate a unit of code from all of its external dependencies. Rather than organize your code in complicated ways just so you can test it more easily, you can use a mock framework to create fake ("mock") objects that pretend to be dependencies. Research the Mockito framework, and learn how to set it up in Android Studio. Write a test class for the calcButton() method in SimpleCalc, and use Mockito to simulate the Android context in which your tests will run.
